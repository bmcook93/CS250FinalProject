How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are interpretted using "user stories," which take the needs of the customer and summarize them in a short, effective sentence following the format: "As a <role>, I want <something> so that <benefit>." This allows development teams to quickly understand the needs of the customer to more efficiently implement functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing programs needs to keep the needs of the customers in mind. Providing functional software quickly is important, to keep up with constantly changing trends and promote innovation. Agile practices, such as daily meetings, are something I would like to incorporate into my future development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is someone who is self-organizing and independent, but also willing to assist other team members with working through issues. A good team member will take initiative and set goals for how they will work on specific user stories.
